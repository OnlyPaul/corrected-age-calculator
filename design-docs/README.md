## Medical Context

### What is Corrected Age?
Corrected age (also called adjusted age) is the age a preterm infant would be if they had been born at full term (40 weeks gestation). It's used to assess whether preterm infants are meeting developmental milestones appropriately.

### What is Postmenstrual Age?
Postmenstrual age (PMA) is the time elapsed since the onset of the mother's last menstrual period. It combines gestational age at birth with the time since birth.

### Why Are These Calculations Important?
- **Medical Assessment**: Healthcare providers use these calculations to evaluate development
- **Parent Education**: Helps parents understand their preterm baby's development timeline
- **Research**: Used in medical studies and clinical trials
- **Clinical Care**: Guides timing of medical interventions and assessments

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)
- [ ] Basic HTML structure and styling
- [ ] Core calculation engine
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Results display
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design

### Phase 2: Enhanced UX
- [ ] Real-time calculations
- [ ] Help and educational content
- [ ] Improved error handling
- [ ] Accessibility improvements

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Offline functionality
- [ ] Print/export capabilities
- [ ] Multiple date format support
- [ ] Internationalization

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
